I am a data scientist with an academic background in behavioural science, based in Berlin. I investigate choice processes by combining a wide range of statistical tools to promote smarter and better-informed decisions.  I combine my expertise in experimental design and data analysis with my analytical skills to provide stakeholders with data-driven insights.
